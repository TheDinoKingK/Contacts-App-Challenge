simple contacts application

you can:
add/create contacts
edit contacts
delete contacts

you can access these actions via a dropdown menu at the top of the window

all contacts will be displayed from a TableView control

add code to the contactdata class to complete challenge (wait Its that easy?)

hints:
1. in addition to the ContactData class, you'll need a Contact class to store individual contacts.
   for each contact, you'll store the first name, last name, phone number, and notes

2. To get data binding to work with the TableView, you'll want to store the contact information
   as simpleStringProperty fields.

3. The Todolist application we worked on in an earlier lecture covers 90% of what you'll need to complete the challenge
